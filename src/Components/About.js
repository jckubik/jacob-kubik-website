                Hi there! I'm software engineer that enjoys solving problems across the stack - usually with JavaScript and React on the frontend and various languages on the backend.

                In my free time, you can find me playing with my dog, Ci√°ran,
                watching a good movie, getting some exercise, enjoying video
                games, or hanging out with friends.
